h1. Simple make_permalink Gem

*make_permalink* is a simple gem that allows you to easily create permalinks (url-friendly-output) for methods in your objects. You don't need any database storage to make it work which is just awesome!

h1. Example

  <pre>
     class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
        make_permalink :title
     end
  
     p = Post.create(:title => "Hello World!")
     p.permalink   # => "1-hello-world"
  </pre>
  
  If you're using rails and you want your url's to have the permalink and not only the id, just add the *to_param* method to your model
  
  <pre>
     class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
        make_permalink :title
        
        def to_param
          permalink
        end
     end
  </pre>
  
h1. Options

  You can have a permalink that won't change non-ascii.
  
  <tt> :replace_non_ascii </tt>:: If set to false non-ascii chars won't be replaced. Default is true
  
  <pre>
    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      make_permalink :title, :replace_non_ascii => false
    end
  
    p = Post.create(:title => "Let's rock & roll")
    p.permalink   # => "1-let-s-rock-roll"
    
  </pre>
  
  Notice that if you don't replace non-ascii chars the permalik would be way cooler (thanks to the "stringex":https://github.com/svenfuchs/stringex gem)
  
  <pre>
    # You will get this with the default behavior 
    p.permalink  # => "1-lets-rock-and-roll"
  </pre>
